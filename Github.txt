Git Hub

Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. 
Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. 
Untracked files are everything else – any files in your working directory that were not in
 your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. 
 When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified 
 because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything.
